    "6. What are the five levels of logging?\n",
    "Ans.The five levels of logging in increasing order of severity are:\n",
    "\n",
    "DEBUG: Detailed information, typically useful only for diagnosing problems. Debug-level messages are usually intended for developers during the development and troubleshooting process.\n",
    "\n",
    "INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected. Info-level messages provide general information about the progress or status of the application. They give a broader picture of the execution flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING: An indication that something unexpected happened or an indication of a potential problem. Warning-level messages highlight issues that could potentially cause problems or may require attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "ERROR: An indication of a more serious problem or error that has occurred. Error-level messages signify failures or errors that prevent the software from functioning as intended, but the application can still continue running.\n",
    "\n",
    "CRITICAL: A very severe error or critical condition that may cause the application to terminate. Critical-level messages highlight severe failures or errors that require immediate attention, as they can lead to the application's abnormal termination or loss of critical functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "These five levels allow developers to categorize and prioritize log messages based on their severity and importance. By setting the logging level appropriately, you can control which messages are captured and logged based on the specific needs of your application.\n",

    "8.Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?\n",
    "Ans.Flexibility and configurability: Logging provides more flexibility and configurability compared to print() statements. With logging, you can control the output format, destination (e.g., console, file), and log levels for different parts of your code. You can enable or disable logging messages based on the severity level or adjust the log output dynamically without modifying the code. This makes it easier to manage and customize the logging behavior as per your requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log levels and filtering: Logging supports different log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to categorize and prioritize messages. This allows you to selectively capture and view specific levels of messages. You can filter log output based on the log level, which is helpful for debugging and troubleshooting. With print() statements, you don't have built-in levels or filters, making it harder to differentiate and manage messages effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Granular control and verbosity: Logging enables you to have fine-grained control over the level of detail in your logs. You can add debug-level messages to provide detailed information during development and troubleshooting, but easily disable them in production. With print() statements, you need to manually add or remove them from your code, leading to cluttered code and potential oversight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Centralized logging configuration: Logging allows you to configure the logging behavior in a central location, such as a configuration file or a logging setup function. This makes it easier to manage and maintain logging across your application or modules. On the other hand, print() statements are typically scattered throughout the code, making it harder to modify or disable them consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration with existing logging frameworks: Logging integrates well with existing logging frameworks and libraries, providing additional features like log rotation, log file compression, log rotation based on file size or time, logging to remote servers, and more. These features are not readily available with print() statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardized approach: Logging follows a standardized approach for logging messages, making it easier for developers to understand and work with code that adheres to common logging practices. It allows for better collaboration and easier maintenance of codebases."

    "10.After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop ?\n",
    "Ans. After clicking the Continue button in a debugger, the debugger will continue the program's execution without any further interruption until it reaches one of the following conditions:\n",
    "Next Breakpoint: If there are additional breakpoints set in the code, the debugger will stop when it reaches the next breakpoint. Breakpoints act as designated pause points, allowing you to inspect the program's state at specific locations.\n",

    "Ans.A breakpoint is a debugging feature that allows you to pause the execution of a program at a specific line of code. By setting breakpoints, you can halt the program's execution at strategic points and inspect the program's state, variables, and behavior at that particular moment.\n",
    "When a program reaches a breakpoint during debugging, it enters a \"break\" state, and the debugger takes control. This allows you to examine the program's internal state, step through the code, modify variables, and perform various debugging operations."
