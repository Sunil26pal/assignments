    "1.In what modes should the PdfFileReader() and PdfFileWriter() File objects will be opened?\n",
    "Ans. In Python's PyPDF2 library, the PdfFileReader() and PdfFileWriter() objects are used to read from and write to PDF files, respectively. These objects are typically created by passing file objects opened in specific modes. The appropriate modes for each object are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "PdfFileReader(): This object is used for reading from an existing PDF file. You should open the file in binary mode ('rb') to ensure that the file is read correctly. The 'r' indicates that the file will be opened for reading, and the 'b' indicates binary mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "PdfFileWriter(): This object is used for creating a new PDF file or modifying an existing one. You should open the file in binary mode ('wb') to ensure that the file is written correctly. The 'w' indicates that the file will be opened for writing, and the 'b' indicates binary mode. Here's an example:"
